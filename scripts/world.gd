extends Node2D

## This scene is the root of the game world - Consider it the "Main Scene".
## Other scenes like Main Menu UI, Multiplayer Lobby UI, or the Game's Levels
## are all added or removed as children of this World scene.
## This means that game game never truly "switches" between scenes at the root.
## The World scene persists through the entire execution of the game.
## 
## The draw-back of this is that we probably can't run the individual child
## "level" scenes on their own and expect them to work. However, in a 
## multiplayer game there are so many other systems too, that it's never going
## to be easy to do that.
